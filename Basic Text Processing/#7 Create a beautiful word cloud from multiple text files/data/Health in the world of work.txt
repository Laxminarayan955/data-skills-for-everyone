Thursday December 9th WHO is launching the formalized Health in the World of Work Network (H-WoW Network), which brings together key stakeholders for the purposes of strengthening collaboration and knowledge sharing to enable network actors to take informed action, placing “health at the centre” of pandemic preparedness and response and for building healthy, safe and resilient workplaces for all workers. 

The H-WoW Network is a cross-departmental initiative between Health and Multilateral Partnerships, Global Infectious Hazards Preparedness and Environment, Climate Change and Health. The initiative follows the World of Work Dialogue in December 2020 which took stock of lessons learned from COVID-19 for future epidemic and pandemic preparedness.  

Network actors, including member states, INGOs, NGOs, academic institutions and the private sector will convene routinely to share good practice examples, share related WHO guidance, and enable feedback from world of work representatives regarding information needs and concerns. Outcomes of the closed meetings will be made public.  

General information for employers and workers regarding COVID-19 can be found  here.
